# Langfuse Integration: Issues, Setup, and Resolution

## Executive Summary

This document series chronicles the complex journey of integrating Langfuse observability with Pipecat voice agents, highlighting the challenges encountered with OpenTelemetry (OTEL) authentication, the extensive work required for local Langfuse setup, and the successful resolution through SDK integration.

## Core Issues Encountered

### 1. Pipecat OTEL Authentication Failures
- **Problem**: "Invalid public key" errors despite valid API credentials
- **Impact**: Complete failure of trace ingestion from Pipecat to Langfuse
- **Root Cause**: Authentication mechanism differences between cloud and self-hosted Langfuse

### 2. Complex Local Infrastructure Setup
- **Problem**: Multi-service Docker Compose setup with interdependent services
- **Impact**: Significant time investment in infrastructure configuration
- **Components**: PostgreSQL, ClickHouse, Redis, MinIO, Langfuse Web/Worker

### 3. SDK vs OTLP Integration Confusion
- **Problem**: Langfuse SDK working while OTLP failing with same credentials
- **Impact**: Initial assumption that OTLP was the correct integration path
- **Discovery**: SDK internally configures OTLP with proper authentication

## Resolution Path

```

## Work Required

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup (4+ hours)
- Docker Compose configuration for 6 services
- Environment variable management
- Database initialization and API key creation
- Service dependency resolution

### Phase 2: Authentication Debugging (3+ hours)
- OTLP header format analysis
- Self-hosted vs cloud authentication differences
- Network request inspection
- Authentication mechanism reverse engineering

### Phase 3: SDK Integration (2+ hours)
- SDK vs OTLP approach evaluation
- Pipecat integration configuration
- Environment variable setup
- Testing and verification

## Success Metrics

✅ **Langfuse Local Instance**: Fully operational with all services
✅ **API Authentication**: Working for SDK integration
✅ **Trace Ingestion**: Verified in ClickHouse database
✅ **Pipecat Integration**: Ready for production use

## Lessons Learned

1. **Self-hosted authentication differs from cloud**
2. **SDK provides better integration than direct OTLP**
3. **Local infrastructure requires significant setup**
4. **Debug logging is essential for troubleshooting**
5. **ClickHouse stores traces, not PostgreSQL**
